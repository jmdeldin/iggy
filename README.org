* =iggy=: Adjust Display Brightness for Intel Graphics Cards

This is a wrapper script for editing my Thinkpad T460p's
/sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness file.

** Usage

Run the following as root or prefix with =sudo=:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  # increase display brightness
  iggy display +10

  # decrease display brightness
  iggy display -10

  # increase keyboard brightness
  iggy keyboard +1

  # decrease keyboard brightness
  iggy keyboard -1
#+END_SRC

*** Tired of using =sudo=? Want to use your media keys?

Add a line to =/etc/sudoers= or create a new file, =/etc/sudoers.d/iggy=
with the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  myuser ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /path/to/iggy
#+END_SRC
